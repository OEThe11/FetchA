# Fetch A Instructions/Overview

This App displays the instructions given to me by Recruiter Scott. The App starts off with a Splash Screen, then proceeds to a loading indicator, which then transfers to the MainScreen. Behind the scenes, the app is using the API that was given. It is then getting filtered out in the repository before it is injected to a local room database. Then the database is displayed on a Jetpack Compose UI. This is all structured in MVVM format. There is also some unit testing involved, with test to the room database and the Entity Class. Thank you.
